# CodingCats 😺

CodingCats is a purr-fect platform designed to bridge the gap between engineers and talent acquisition teams, slashing job hunting time from months down to days!

## Overview

This platform connects talented engineers with recruiters, eliminating the back-and-forth typically associated with the hiring process. With interactive profiles, seamless communication tools, and powerful analytics, CodingCats transforms how tech hiring happens.

## Features

- **Interactive Engineer Profiles**: Browse through floating profile cards with sound effects and cat-themed puns
- **Streamlined Waitlist System**: Join as either an engineer or recruiter (we don't discriminate between cats and dogs!)
- **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive design with smooth animations that will make you purr with satisfaction
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track engagement metrics and hiring pipeline faster than a cat chasing a laser pointer
- **Unified Communication**: Direct messaging between engineers and recruiters that's the cat's meow!

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI library (like catnip for developers)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Static typing (because cats are precise)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework (as flexible as a cat's spine)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - UI component library (sleek and elegant, just like our feline friends)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool and development server (faster than a cat at 3 AM)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Client-side routing (never get lost in the alley)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) - Data fetching and state management (as reliable as a cat's landing reflexes)
- [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) - Toast notifications (pop up like cats in cardboard boxes)
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) - Data visualization (prettier than a Persian's coat)
